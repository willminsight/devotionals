== Installation ==
= To install the plugin manually in WordPress: =

1. Login as Admin on your WordPress blog.
2. Click on the “Plugins” tab in the left menu.
3. Select “Add New.”
4. Click on “Upload” at the top of the page.
5. Select the ‘devotionals.zip’ on your computer, and upload. Activate the plugin once it is uploaded.

= To install the plugin manually with FTP: =

1. Unzip the ‘devotionals.zip’ file. Upload that folder to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory.
2. Login to your WordPress dashboard and activate the plugin through the “Plugins” tab in the left menu.

= To configure the plugin options: =

1. Login to your WordPress dashboard and go to Settings -> Devotionals in the left menu.
2. Define your permalink slug (url path) for your devotionals section. (e.g.: "read/devotionals" if your main devotionals page should live under the "read" section.)
3. Choose to use standard archives or a customized page that lists your devotionals.
4. Optionally, enable biblegateway.com links in your RSS Feed to link to the main scripture reference for each of your devotionals. Then define a default version of the Bible you want to use on biblegateway.com. (For example, if you want to use the New Living Translation on biblegateway, enter "NLT" for your default version. You can discover which versions biblegateway.com offers from the dropdown in their top search bar. Please note that biblegateway.com may not offer both New Testament and Old Testament searches in some non-English translations of the Bible.)
5. Optionally, if you want to offer an easy "Tweet This" button below each devotional's pull-quote, then you will need to add your bit.ly login and API key so that the url of each devotional can be shortened and included in the tweet. If most of your devotionals are written by a main pastor, then select the main author's WP user account from the Default Author dropdown, and then define their twitter handle by editing their user profile.
